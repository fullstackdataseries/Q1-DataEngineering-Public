# Welcome to the Data Engineering GitHub for the 2024 Full Stack Data Workshops!

My name is [Sam LaFell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samlafell/) and I'm a graduate of the Institute for Advanced Analytics (IAA), the very place where we will be doing our classes.

Thanks to the IAA for letting us use this space!

I've been working mostly as a Data Scientist over the last few years, but in August 2023, I transitioned into more Data Platform and Data Engineering work in the Pharma space.

## Pre-Requistes and Assumptions about who you are

## What is Data Engineering

_From the Book [Fundamentals of Data Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Engineering-Robust-Systems/dp/1098108302/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=676976511340&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9009673&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=11237717600805968549&hvtargid=kwd-902459765949&hydadcr=22134_13517537&keywords=fundamentals+of+data+engineering&qid=1700363631&sr=8-1) by Joe Reis and Matt Housley_

Data Engineering is many things, as you can see from the image above.

Joe and Matt Define Data Engineering and Data Engineers as:
```
“Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.”

## What is this workshop?

In this workshop, we are going to cover a few topics within the Data Engineering space. This is part of a much larger concept, the Full Stack Data Engineering workshops is a Year-Long workshop series that meets once a month.

The goal of the DE quarter is to introduce you to concepts, tools, and goals of Data Engineering. I want to demystify some maybe complex technologies or concepts you've heard of before.

### What Will we do?

Make sure to check out the Folders for each Workshop in this Public Preview. They contain the README for each workshop, which will show you what each day will be able.

This will hopefully give you enough information to make your decision.


### Structure of the Sessions
We will have dinner, networking, short powerpoints, followed by a much longer time for a hands-on lab.

I, Sam, will be displaying on a projector what I'm doing, and you all can follow along hands-on-keyboard, or just watch. The sesssions will be recorded so you can watch them later.

### Why does this cost money?
I have put a lot of time and effort into creating these labs. Nights and weekends have been spent working on this. Not to make money, but to provide quality content. The $15 per session per person fee covers the pizzas that we will provide, and encourages you to stay involved and really get the most out of the sessions.
